## Install SuperTokens website package
```js
npm i --save supertokens-website@^3.1.0
```

This library provides a wrapper around ```fetch``` or ```axios```.

You may get a warning about ```axios``` being a peer dependency for this package. If you use fetch for your API calls you can safely ignore this warning.
